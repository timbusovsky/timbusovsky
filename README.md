Hello!  My name is Tim and I graduated the Part Time Virtual Bootcamp at Tech Elevator in April 2024.  I have been working on a command line application that allows a user to log words and their definitions for their specific account.  The application is written in Java and connects to a database written in SQL.

I have also been working om a full stack web application that that allows a user to enter a Taylor Swift Friendship Bracelet acronym into a text field input, and returns the album title, song title, and lyrics that the input acronym corresponds to. The page background color also changes to reflect the predominant color for each respective album era. Backend written in SQL and Java using pgAdmin, IntelliJ IDEA, and Spring. Frontend written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and Vue.js. Both the server and client code are publically available at github.com/timbusovsky/TSFBD and github.com/timbusovsky/TSFBD-Client

To run the application locally:

1. Pull both the TSFBD and TSFBD-Client repositories
2. Execute the SQL script available in github.com/timbusovsky/TSFBD titled "Master SQL" in a database management application to create a database of albums, songs, and lyrics. The default name of the database is: ITDB. The default passwword for the database is: postgres1
3. Open the TSFBD folder in an IDE such as IntelliJ and start the server
4. Open the TSFBD-Client folder in Visual Studio Code
5. Launch the client in the command prompt using the command: npm run dev
6. The local app should now connect to the local server and database and launch a web browser to display the site
