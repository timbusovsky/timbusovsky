Hello!  My name is Tim and I graduated the Part Time Bootcamp at Tech Elevator in April 2024.  I have been working on a command line application that allows a user to log words and their definitions for their specific account.  The application is written in Java and connects to a database written in SQL.

I have also created a full stack web application that  that allows a user to enter a Taylor Swift Friendship Bracelet acronym into a text field input, and returns the album title, song title, and lyrics that the input acronym corresponds to.  The page background color also changes to reflect the predominant color for each respective album era.  Backend written in SQL and Java using pgadmin, IntelliJ IDEA., and Spring.  Frontend written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and Vue.js. Both the server and client code are publically available at github.com/timbusovsky/TSFBD and github.com/timbusovsky/TSFBD-Client.
